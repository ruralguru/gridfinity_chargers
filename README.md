# gridfinity_chargers
Dependency:
https://github.com/kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad

Put these in open SCAD library folder.
I opted to leave the kennetek library in folders and modify their calls.
Otherwise modify the include statement in the openscad files.
NOTES: fabricated on CR-30. as such overhangs are a different beast for me, please advise when created


Currently includes: Watch charger 1x5 with bins as supported.
